        <h2>Wisdom of Akbar and Birbal</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Birbal.jpg" alt="Akbar and Birbal" class="story-image">
        <p>Akbar the Great, one of the most celebrated emperors in Indian history, was known for his wisdom and tolerance. His court was adorned with scholars, poets, and wits, but none stood out like his clever minister, Birbal.</p>
        <p>Many stories illustrate the clever exchanges between Akbar and Birbal, with Birbal often using his quick wit to resolve dilemmas or teach moral lessons. In one famous tale, Birbal was challenged to find a way to determine the true friend among the courtiers. He suggested a test involving a pot of ghee (clarified butter) to reveal those who would be honest and those who would be deceitful.</p>
        <p>Their bond was a perfect blend of wisdom and humor, and their stories continue to be cherished in Indian folklore.</p>
