        <p>Tenali Raman, a legendary figure in Indian folklore, was a poet and a court jester in the court of King Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara. Known for his sharp wit and cleverness, he often outsmarted his adversaries and solved complex problems with ease.</p>
        <p>One famous tale recounts how Raman cleverly tricked a thief into revealing his identity by pretending to have the power to predict the future. By making the thief believe he was under surveillance, Raman was able to expose him and win a reward from the king.</p>
        <p>Through his humorous stories, Tenali Raman teaches us valuable lessons about intelligence, creativity, and the power of wit in overcoming challenges.</p>
